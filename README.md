# Pain Placebo Project: Preprocessing and Effective Connectivity Analysis Scripts

This repository contains scripts designed for the preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data and the implementation of effective connectivity analysis, specifically developed for the Pain Placebo Project. These scripts are intended to facilitate the processing of imaging data to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying pain perception and the placebo effect. 

## Features

PreprocessingrfMRI.m: Scripts to prepare fMRI data for analysis, including steps such as motion correction, spatial normalization, and smoothing (using SPM12)
DCM_left_right.m, PEB_cv_1.m, PEB_cv_2.m: Codes to analyze the effective connectivity between brain regions, allowing for the exploration of neural interactions and networks in the context of pain and placebo responses.

## Contribution

Feedback and contributions to these scripts are welcome to enhance their functionality and user-friendliness. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


Thank you for your interest in our project and its associated scripts. We hope they will be valuable in your research endeavors.
